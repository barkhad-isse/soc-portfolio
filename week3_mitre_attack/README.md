# Week 3: MITRE ATT&CK Analysis

## Objective

In this week, the focus was on simulating suspicious activity (e.g., network scans) on the Kali Linux VM and verifying that the Wazuh SIEM, running on the Ubuntu VM, can detect and log these events correctly. The goal was to understand how endpoint activities generate alerts and are forwarded to the SIEM.

## Steps Performed

1. Ran host-based activity on the Kali agent to generate logs (e.g., Nmap scans and privileged commands).
2. Opened the MITRE ATT&CK dashboard in Wazuh and refreshed to view recent activity.
3. Reviewed the top tactics and techniques triggered by our actions.
